## Inspiration
How to better understand the magnitude of the growing numbers, convey findings in an illustrative manner and spread awareness.

## What it does
Visualizes the number of active cases per country, per city (barplot,lineplot, heatmap)

## How I built it
Using Rstudio, we embedded R code into ShinyDashboard framework, implementing customizations and user functions with HTML/CSS.

## Challenges I ran into
Find accurate, up-to-date data and presenting them properly, fact-checking interpretations at every step. The wrong analysis in this atmosphere can lead to very frightening findings.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Strong collaboration, work-ethic, time management, application of classroom knowledge and skills

## What I learned
The multitude of the numbers growing exponentially.

## What's next for COVID-19 Tracker
With more data, forecast/project numbers. Find the peak and when it starts to plateau. These will provide hints or clues for the coming days, weeks and advise stakeholders on how to best prepare for the coming worst.
